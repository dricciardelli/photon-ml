/**
 * Performs a guided random search of the given ranges, where the search is guided by a Gaussian Process estimated from
 * evaluations of the actual evaluation function. Since we assume that the evaluation function is very costly (as it
 * often is for doing a full train / cycle evaluation of a machine learning model), it makes sense to spend time doing
 * what would otherwise be considered an expensive computation to reduce the number of times we need to evaluate the
 * function.
 *
 * At a high level, the search routine proceeds as follows:
 *
 *  1) Assume a uniform prior over the evaluation function
 *  2) Receive a new observation, and use it along with any previous observations to train a new Gaussian Process
 *     regression model for the evaluation function. This approximation is the new posterior over the evaluation
 *     function.
 *  3) Sample candidates uniformly, evaluate the posterior for each, and select the candidate with the highest predicted
 *     evaluation.
 *  4) Evaluate the best candidate with the actual evaluation function to acquire a new observation.
 *  5) Repeat from step 2.
 *
 * @param ranges the value ranges within which to search. There should be one for every dimension in the space.
 * @param evaluationFunction the function that evaluates points in the space to real values
 * @param evaluator the original evaluator
 * @param discreteParams specifies the indices of parameters that should be treated as discrete values
 * @param candidatePoolSize the number of candidate points to draw at each iteration. Larger numbers give more precise
 *   results, but also incur higher computational cost.
 * @param noisyTarget whether to include observation noise in the evaluation function model
 * @param seed the random seed value
